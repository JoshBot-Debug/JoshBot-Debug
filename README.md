# Hey there...! :blush:

My name is Joshua Myers.

I'm ecstatic about Typescript. I've used several languages till now. However, Typescript takes the cake! :satisfied:

- _Typescript, Javascript_
- _Redis, MySQL_
- _HTML, CSS, SASS_
- _Node.js, React.js, Next.js_
- _React Native_
- _Linux (Debian)_

I have knowledge about microservices, security on debian, networking, switches, firewalls, and more.
