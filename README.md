# Hey there...! :blush:

My name is Joshua Myers, I have a passion for solving problems and creating them ðŸ˜†

I'm absolutely obsessed with OOP :satisfied:

So far, these are some of the languages and frameworks I'm familiar with.

- _C#, .NET_
- _PHP, MySQL, Symfony_
- _HTML, CSS, SASS_
- _Javascript, JQuery, React.js_
- _Python, Django_
- _Java

However..., I'd say React Native and node.js with typescript is my pillar of strength.
