# Hey there...! :blush:

My name is Joshua Myers, Software and Web Developer, I code to solve and automate everyday tasks, build applications to save time and improve efficiency.

I always implement __Object Oriented Principles__ in my applications wherever I see fit, like the MVC model, and commonly used design patterns such as the strategy pattern, observer pattern, etc. I'm absolutely obsessed with OOP :satisfied:

So far, these are some of the languages and frameworks I'm very familiar with.

- _C#, .NET_
- _PHP, MySQL, Symfony_
- _HTML, CSS, SASS_
- _Javascript, JQuery, React.js_
- _Python, Django_

However, I'm not stopping there, I've been learning C++ in my spare time. Feel free to check out my GitHub repository and my official website to see some of the work I've done.
