# Hey there...! :blush:

My name is Joshua Myers, I have a passion for solving problems and creating them ðŸ˜†

I'm absolutely obsessed with OOP :satisfied:

So far, these are some of the languages and frameworks I'm very familiar with.

- _C#, .NET_
- _PHP, MySQL, Symfony_
- _HTML, CSS, SASS_
- _Javascript, JQuery, React.js_
- _Python, Django_
- _Java

I've been learning C++ in my spare time. Feel free to check out my GitHub repository and my official website to see some of the work I've done.
