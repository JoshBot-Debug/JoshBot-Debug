# Hey there...! :blush:

My name is Joshua Myers, Software and Web Developer, I code to solve and automate everyday tasks, build applications to save time and improve efficiency.

I always implement Object Oriented Principles in my applications wherever I see fit, like the MVC model, and commonly used design patterns such as the strategy pattern, observer pattern, etc.

So far, these are some of the languages and frameworks I'm very familiar with.

- PHP, MySQL, Symfony
- HTML, CSS, SASS
- Javascript, JQuery, React.js
- Python, Django

However, I'm not stopping there, I've been learning C# through Unity 3D and C++ in my spare time.
Feel free to check out my GitHub repository and my official website to see some of the work I've done.
